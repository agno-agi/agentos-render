# AgentOS: FastAPI for Agents

AgentOS turns your agents into a production API. One AI backend that serves every frontend.

1. **Your product.** Call the REST API from your app: run agents, stream responses, and manage sessions, memory, and knowledge.
2. **AgentOS UI.** Chat with agents, build new ones, and inspect sessions, traces, memory, and evals from the AgentOS UI at [os.agno.com](https://os.agno.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=example-repo&utm_campaign=agentos-render&utm_content=agentos-render&utm_term=render).
3. **Coding agents.** Manage the full agent development lifecycle (create, extend, improve, eval and review) using the skills in [`.agents/skills/`](.agents/skills/).
4. **AI apps.** MCP clients like Claude and ChatGPT can use your agents through the MCP server at `/mcp`.
5. **Chat interfaces.** Chat with your agents from Slack, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Discord.

## Get Started

Copy this prompt into your favorite coding agent. It sets up the platform and builds your first agent with you:

```text
Help me set up my agent platform and build my first agent.

Clone https://github.com/agno-agi/agentos-render.git into a folder called agent-platform, cd in, and run the setup-platform skill (in .agents/skills/).
```

Your coding agent drives the whole flow: it checks Docker, sets up `.env`, boots the platform, verifies the MCP endpoint, and builds your first agent with you. Prefer to drive yourself? See [Manual Setup](#manual-setup).

## Built for agents

This codebase comes with:

- **Two platform agents** that help you build and run the platform from your favorite AI apps like Claude and ChatGPT. **Agent Builder** creates agents, teams, and workflows using the AgentOS Studio. **Platform Manager** understands, monitors, and explains the platform: codebase questions, eval history, deployment checks, schedules.
- **Coding-agent skills** let Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and other coding agents build, test, and improve the platform automatically — see [Using the platform](#using-the-platform).

Trace data, agent code, evals, and system logs are all available to coding agents, so the platform can inspect and improve itself end to end.

## Manual Setup

### Step 1: Run locally

> **Prerequisite:** [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) installed and running.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/agno-agi/agentos-render.git agentos
cd agentos

# Configure credentials
cp example.env .env
# Open .env and set OPENAI_API_KEY

# Run the platform on docker
docker compose up -d --build
```

Confirm your AgentOS is running at [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs).

### Step 2: Connect the AgentOS UI

1. Open [os.agno.com](https://os.agno.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=example-repo&utm_campaign=agentos-render&utm_content=agentos-render&utm_term=render) and sign in.
2. Click **Connect OS**, enter `http://localhost:8000` as the URL, name it **Local AgentOS**, and connect.

### Step 3: Build your first agent

1. Click **Chat** under the **Agent Builder** agent and try the first prompt: "Build an agent that tracks AI news and writes a daily brief". Go through the agent development process.
2. Once created, click the **Refresh** button on the top right. You should now see the "Daily AI News Brief" agent in the **Agents** dropdown. Click the newly created agent.
3. Ask: "What's new with Anthropic?"

### Step 4: Check platform health

Click **Chat** under **Platform Manager** and ask: "How healthy is the platform?" It answers from the codebase and runtime data — eval history, deployment checks, schedules, and the component you just built.

## Run in production

You can run the platform anywhere that supports containerized images. This template deploys to [Render](https://render.com) via the Blueprint in [`render.yaml`](render.yaml) — Render builds the Dockerfile and provisions managed Postgres (pgvector included) in one launch.

> **Prerequisites:** a [Render](https://render.com) account with this repo (your copy of it) reachable from Render, and a `RENDER_API_KEY` (dashboard → Account Settings → API Keys) for the scripts.

### 1. Set up your production env

Create a new `.env.production` file for production credentials.

```sh
cp .env .env.production          # or cp example.env .env.production
# Edit .env.production with production values
```

Keeping a separate `.env.production` lets us use different values for local and production: different OpenAI keys, production-only credentials, a different Slack workspace.

### 2. Deploy

Launch the Blueprint: dashboard.render.com → **New +** → **Blueprint**, connect your copy of this repo, and apply — Render reads [`render.yaml`](render.yaml), prompts for `OPENAI_API_KEY`, builds the Dockerfile, and creates the `basic-256mb` Postgres (first build ~10 min). The web service runs on the `starter` plan — the cheapest that never sleeps, which the in-process scheduler and MCP streams require — as a **single instance by design** (two instances double-fire every cron).

Then wire the rest:

```sh
./scripts/render/up.sh
```

It waits for the Blueprint service to appear, pins `AGENTOS_URL` to the real service URL — `render.yaml` can't express "my own URL", and without it scheduled jobs silently never fire — generates `MCP_CONNECT_SECRET` (the chat-app OAuth consent secret, printed once in the closing summary), and pauses for a JWT verification key (see next section).

### 3. Production Auth

Token-Based Authorization is on by default. Without a `JWT_VERIFICATION_KEY` or `JWT_JWKS_FILE`, the app refuses to serve traffic in production. The platform's job is to keep your data private, so the safe default is "refuse to start" without an authentication token.

Token-Based Auth gives you three things:

1. **No public access.** The server rejects requests without a valid token.
2. **Per-request identity.** Middleware parses the token and extracts the `user_id`, `session_id`, and custom claims. Each request is tied to a user and session, giving you auditability and traceability.
3. **Granular permissions.** User tokens can run an agent and view their own sessions. Admin tokens read everyone's sessions and test any agent.

During `./scripts/render/up.sh`, once the service URL exists the script pauses so you can mint the key.

1. Open [os.agno.com](https://os.agno.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=example-repo&utm_campaign=agentos-render&utm_content=agentos-render&utm_term=render), click **Connect OS** → **Live**, enter your onrender.com URL, and connect.
2. Name it **Live AgentOS**.
3. Go to **Settings** → **OS & Security**.
4. Turn **Token-Based Authorization (JWT)** on.
5. Copy the public key.
6. Paste the full public key into the `up.sh` prompt. The script saves it into your env file for future syncs:

```sh
JWT_VERIFICATION_KEY="-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MIIBIjANBgkq...
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----"
```

> **Heads up.** Live AgentOS Connections are a paid feature. Use `PLATFORM30` to get 1 month off. We are working on a free trial so you don't have to pay to try.

If you run non-interactively or skip the prompt, you can sync environment variables later with `./scripts/render/env-sync.sh`.

### 4. Register your production AgentOS to MCP clients

Re-run `uvx agno connect`, this time pointed at your deployed domain, to connect Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Codex, and Cursor to your production platform:

```sh
uvx agno connect --url https://<your-onrender-domain>
```

For **claude.ai and ChatGPT (web)**: add `https://<your-onrender-domain>/mcp` as a custom connector in the chat app's connector settings. Leave the form's optional OAuth fields (client ID / client secret) empty. Click **Connect** and, on the consent page, enter the `MCP_CONNECT_SECRET` that `up.sh` generated during deploy (saved in `.env.production`).

### 5. Verify

The script prints the service URL — open `/docs` on it. Logs live in the dashboard: your service → **Logs**.

### 6. Redeploy after code changes

`autoDeploy: true` is on in render.yaml, so **pushing to your deploy branch redeploys automatically** — that's the normal flow. To re-run a build without a new commit:

```sh
./scripts/render/redeploy.sh
```

Render builds the pushed branch; local uncommitted changes never deploy.

### 7. Sync environment variables

To re-sync environment variables, run the following command:

```sh
./scripts/render/env-sync.sh
```

Each key is upserted individually (never the destructive replace-all API call), then one deploy applies it all.

### 8. Tear down

```sh
./scripts/render/down.sh
```

Deletes the agent-os service and the agentos-db Postgres, **including all data**, and verifies both are gone before declaring success.

### Opting out of JWT (not recommended)

Set `authorization=False` in [`app/main.py`](app/main.py) and redeploy. Use this only inside a private VPC behind another auth layer. Without it, anyone who reaches your AgentOS URL can access your platform.

## Using the platform

This platform is designed so that coding agents can drive the entire **create → improve → evaluate → maintain** lifecycle for you.

### Create

Open your coding agent of choice (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor) and run:

```
/create-new-agent
```

It asks a few questions, generates the agent file in `agents/`, registers it in `app/main.py`, adds its description and quick prompts to `app/config.yaml`, restarts the container, and smoke-tests it live.

### Improve

Improve your agents by running the following skills:

- **`/extend-agent`** — Add a tool, add a capability, refine the instructions, fix a known bug.
- **`/improve-agent`** — Claude simulates scenarios from the agent's `INSTRUCTIONS`, runs them against the live container, judges the responses, and edits until they pass.

### Evaluate

Run the eval suite to check for regressions. The evals live in [`evals/cases.py`](evals/cases.py), and run history shows up at os.agno.com next to your sessions and traces.

The evals run on the host machine, so set up the venv with `./scripts/venv_setup.sh && source .venv/bin/activate`, then:

```sh
python -m evals --tag smoke      # fast checks of the self-driving surfaces
python -m evals --tag release    # broader pre-release confidence
python -m evals --name <case>    # one case while iterating
python -m evals -v               # stream the full run with rich panels
```

If a case fails, run **`/eval-and-improve`** — it diagnoses each failure, fixes what's in scope, and loops until green.

### Maintain

Because the repo is managed by coding agents, it moves fast. Run `/review-and-improve` before a release or after a refactor: it sweeps for drift between docs, code, and config, auto-fixes mechanical drift like stale paths and missing env vars, and flags anything bigger.

## Connect more frontends (optional)

AgentOS comes with an MCP server at `/mcp` (enabled by setting `mcp_server=True` in [`app/main.py`](app/main.py)), so any MCP client can call your agents, teams, and workflows through tools like `run_agent`, `run_team`, and `run_workflow`.

Register your AgentOS with the MCP clients on your machine:

```sh
uvx agno connect
```

It auto-detects Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Codex, and Cursor and registers `http://localhost:8000/mcp`. After a successful connection, open one of these apps and ask:

```text
can you access my agentos mcp?
```

**claude.ai and ChatGPT (web).** Hosted AI apps reach your platform over the internet and need an OAuth login. Deploy to production (above), add `https://<domain>/mcp` as a remote connector, and approve the consent page with your connect secret.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | yes | none | OpenAI key for models and embeddings. |
| `RUNTIME_ENV` | no | `prd` | `dev` disables JWT. Compose sets this to `dev` for local — never put `dev` in an env file that env-sync.sh pushes to Render, or production serves unauthenticated. |
| `JWT_VERIFICATION_KEY` | prd | none | Public key from os.agno.com. Required when `RUNTIME_ENV=prd`, unless `JWT_JWKS_FILE` is set. |
| `JWT_JWKS_FILE` | prd | none | Path to a JWKS file; alternative to `JWT_VERIFICATION_KEY` for production JWT verification. |
| `AGENTOS_URL` | no | `http://127.0.0.1:8000` | Scheduler base URL. `scripts/render/up.sh` pins it to the onrender.com service URL after the first deploy (render.yaml can't reference its own URL) and writes it back into your env file. Also the public origin OAuth metadata derives from when `MCP_CONNECT_SECRET` is set. |
| `MCP_CONNECT_SECRET` | no | none | If set (≥16 chars, e.g. `openssl rand -base64 32`), `/mcp` becomes its own OAuth 2.1 authorization server so claude.ai and ChatGPT (web) can connect; connecting asks for this secret on a consent page. Requires `AGENTOS_URL`. `scripts/render/up.sh` auto-generates it on deploy. PAT and JWT bearers keep working alongside. |
| `AGENTOS_MCP_SIGNING_KEY` | no | none | Optional high-entropy signing-key material (≥32 chars) for OAuth tokens. Unset, a strong key is generated and persisted in the database. Rotating it invalidates outstanding tokens. |
| `ENABLE_DEPLOY_CHECK` | no | `True` | The reference deployment-check cron runs daily by default. Set `False` to disable; the workflow is runnable on demand regardless. |
| `ENABLE_SCHEDULED_EVALS` | no | `False` | If `True`, schedules the run-evals workflow daily. Off by default because it uses model calls. |
| `EVALS_TAG` | no | `smoke` | Eval tag run by the run-evals workflow. |
| `EVALS_CASE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | no | `90` | Default per-case timeout for run-evals runs; applies only to cases that don't set their own `timeout_seconds`. |
| `EVALS_SUITE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | no | `900` | Whole-suite timeout for run-evals runs; per-case timeouts are the granular limit. The default bounds the `smoke` tag's worst case (incl. builder-case teardown). |
| `PARALLEL_API_KEY` | no | none | Authenticates the WebSearch Agent's Parallel SDK / MCP connection. |
| `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` / `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` | no | none | Both must be set to enable the Slack interface. |
| `DB_HOST` / `DB_PORT` / `DB_USER` / `DB_PASS` / `DB_DATABASE` | no | matches compose | Postgres connection. |
| `DB_DRIVER` | no | `postgresql+psycopg` | SQLAlchemy driver. |
| `AGNO_DEBUG` | no | `False` | If `True`, Agno emits verbose debug logs. Compose sets this for dev. |
| `WAIT_FOR_DB` | no | `False` | If `True`, the entrypoint blocks on the DB before starting. Compose sets this. |
